# DyPy: A python library for simulating matrix-form games.
## dynamics_sim
A generic evolutionary game theory simulation library.

This is based off of Eric Lubin's wonderful DyPy library. Andrew Ferdowsian updated it to Python 3.0 with additional functionality. It is now extended to include frequency biased imitation and group selection.

For instructions on usage please see the Wiki and for installation information see the README file in the dynamics_sim-master folder. There also exists a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13815.pdf) __"DyPy: A python library for simulating matrix-form games"__ by Anjalika Nande, Andrew Ferdowsian, Eric Lubin, Erez Yoeli and Martin Nowak, that discusses the usefulness of this package along with giving detailed information about its implementation and some example use cases.
